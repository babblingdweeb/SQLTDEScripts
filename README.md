# SQLTDEScripts
Basic scripts for turning TDE on/off for demo purposes

All of these scripts come from the work of:
 https://www.mssqltips.com/sqlservertip/3572/recovering-a-sql-server-tde-encrypted-database-successfully/

I took the scripts in the article and broke them out as listed in the Original folder. The scripts listed in the Basic folder server as my starting point.

All passwords and database names are for demostration use only. The idea here is to create a list of scripts that can be used to enable, create, modify, disable, and manage TDE settings/certificates/passwords through scripting. Maintaining these scripts forsm the baiss of what can be used to stanadardize the process and manage information for backups.
